Renee: You made a temple for me in your BRAIN?!
Narrator: I-it was out of reverence! Out of the memories and the hope of what had--
Renee: Nope! No way. That's it. This is easily the creepiest thing you've ever done.
Narrator: But his undying love for you!
Renee: Oh, undying! I guess the time spent endlessly trying to win back first chair, not returning my calls, ignoring me completely, all that was just a nap for his UNDYING love, huh?

Renee: Oh, HERE we go.
Narrator: Armand. He stole her from poor, pitiful Peter.
Renee: I'm not anyone's to steal!
Narrator: He'll PAY for this!
