Maestro: Ah, I see you've come to avenge your beloved!
Renee: Not my beloved, not big on avenging. Can I leave or should I use the trombone?
Maestro: Harrumph to your double-talk! Master Peter shall never reclaim his first chair! Verily, the whole of the orchestra bends to mine ear and falls into line!
Renee: Peter, Maestro Edward doesn't talk like that. He did Shakespeare in the park ONCE, and it was nice. And is he a penguin because of his tux? Really??
Maestro: Forsooth! Anon! And then some! Enough talk, villain! Have at you!
