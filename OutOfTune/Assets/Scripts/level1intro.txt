Narrator: Meet Peter. A young man with a promising musical career, a loving fiancee, and the promise of many happy years to come. Or so he thought...
Narrator: Tragedy struck, and Peter's life was is shambles! Torn asunder by the fickle tides of fate, he lost everything. Now his mind is in tatters from the cruelty that the world has wrought for him.
Renee: Oh please.
Narrator: Ah! But there is someone who can save him! Renee, the love of his life, can enter his twisted mind and put it at ease.
Renee: Wait, what? No no no, I'm not here on a rescue mission. Let me just set some things straight.
Narrator: But save him she must, lest he be entrapped in agony forever!
Renee: Are you serious?
Narrator: Of course! Here we go!
Renee: Woah!
Narrator: It was here in the icy wastes of the orchestra pits that Peter's coworkers betrayed him, and he lost his cherished role as first chair violinist.
Renee: ...To be a SECOND chair violinist. I've heard this before.
Narrator: Injustice! Brutal injustice that drove him to obsession which made a void in his heart that could never be filled!
Renee: Judging by the lack of times you answered my calls, that's probably true.
Narrator: Oh how he wished he could teach that conductor a lesson for his vindictive ways...
Renee: Vindictive as in "world's smallest demotion"? Whatever, let's get to it.
